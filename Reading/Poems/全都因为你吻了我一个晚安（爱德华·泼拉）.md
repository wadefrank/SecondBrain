我爬上了门，打开楼梯

说完了睡衣，穿上祷告

然后关了床，钻上灯

全都因为你吻了我一个晚安

第二天早上我醒来，搅了鞋

擦亮鸡蛋，烤几片新闻

我连左右都分不清

全都因为你吻了我一个晚安

到了傍晚我总算恢复正常

于是我们再出去一趟

你说“晚安”，又吻了我

我急忙回家，然后……

我头发上扑粉，别好鼻梁

我挂起淋浴，打开衣服

把闹钟赶开，给猫上紧发条

全都因为你吻了我一个晚安

我跑上窗帘，拉下楼梯

我卷起地毯，给头发吸尘

我连左右都分不清

全都因为你吻了我一个晚安

我拿起妈妈打给了电话

我跟狗狗通话给爸爸扔了根骨头

到了半夜太阳还是那么亮

全都因为你吻了我一个晚安

晚安

# And all because you kissed me goodnight

I climbed up the door, and opened the stairs;

I said my pajamas and put on my pray'rs,

I turned off the bed and crawled into the light

And all because you kissed me goodnight.

Next morning I woke and scrambled my shoes;

I shined up an egg, then I toasted the news;

I buttered my tie, and took another bite;

And all because you kissed me goodnight.

By evening I felt normal,

so we went out again

You said "Goodnight," and kissed me,

I hurried home and then...

I powdered my hair, and pinned up my nose;

I hung up the bath, and I turned on my clothes;

I put out the clock, and wound the cat up tight;

And all because you kissed me (kiss) goodnight

I ran up the shade and pulled down the stair;

I curled up the rug, and I vacuumed my hair;

I just couldn't tell my left foot from my right;

And all because you kissed me (kiss) goodnight.

I lifted the preacher and called up the phone;

I spoke to the dog, and I threw your Ma a bone;

'Twas midnight, and yet the sun was shining bright,

And all because you kissed me (kiss) goodnight
