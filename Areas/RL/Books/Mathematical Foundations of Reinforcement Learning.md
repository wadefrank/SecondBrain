# Overview of this Book

Fundamental tools: 
* Chapter 1 : basic concepts, including:
	* state
	* action
	* reward
	* returns
	* policy
* Chapter 2: a key concept and a key tool
	* state value
	* Bellman equation
* Chapter 3: a key concept and a key tool
	* optimal policy
	* Bellman optimality equation

Algorithms/Methods:
* Chapter 4 : three algorithms(share the same structure, first update the value, then update the policy)
	* value iteration
	* policy iteration
	* truncated policy iteration
* Chapter 5: model-free reinforcement learning algorithms(use data), introduces three algorithms based on MC(Monte Carlo) estimation
	* MC Basic
	* two more complicated but more efficient MC-Based algorithm
* Chapter 6: introducing the stochastic approximation theory
	*
